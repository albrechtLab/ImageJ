# ImageJ

These files are used as custom macro pairs (check paths) in ImageJ to automatically track intensity and position over time, given initial user input. The pairs are used for various objective magnifications and applications.

i.e. you will need to change paths to where your macros are located (line 11)

TrackSettingfile="C:\\Program Files\\Micro-Manager-1.4\\macros\\TrckSett_awa_4x_6pxSq.txt";
to
TrackSettingfile="file path\\TrckSett_awa_4x_6pxSq.txt";
